Input file `getallbursts_table_validation_bursts_target_v1.0.csv` recording all attributes needed to run the PST dolphin workflow was generated by the local notebook `getallbursts_CSLC_Create_Validation_Table.ipynb`, which itself was modified from a notebook used to record attributes of CSLCs specified used for Cal/Val (`https://github.com/OPERA-Cal-Val/calval-CSLC/blob/main/validation_data/CSLC_Create_Validation_Table.ipynb`).
